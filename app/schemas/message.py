# This file is intentionally left blank for now.
# The eml-parser library returns a deeply nested dictionary with a variable structure.
# Defining a rigid Pydantic model for it would be complex and brittle.
#
# For this application, we are returning the raw dictionary from the parser.
#
# If you wanted to enforce a specific output structure, you would define
# Pydantic models here. For example:
#
# from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr
# from typing import List, Optional, Dict, Any
#
# class Attachment(BaseModel):
#     filename: str
#     content_type: str
#     size: int
#
# class Header(BaseModel):
#     subject: Optional[str] = None
#     from_addr: Optional[EmailStr] = Field(None, alias='from')
#     to_addrs: Optional[List[EmailStr]] = Field(None, alias='to')
#
# class ParsedMessage(BaseModel):
#     header: Header
#     body: List[Dict[str, Any]]
#     attachments: Optional[List[Attachment]] = None

pass
# This would allow you to validate and document the expected structure.
# However, given the variability of email structures, we will
# simply return the dictionary as-is from the parsing service.
